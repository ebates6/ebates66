								<h2>About me</h2>
								<p> I am currently a Dealer Credit Analyst for 
									<a href="https://www.dnb.com/business-directory/company-profiles.ford_motor_credit_company_llc.cb3110fa6a44f57e2f2e6704cc273538.html">Ford Motor Credit
										 Company</a>. In my 18 years with FMCC, I've held a number of positions and been exposed to nearly every facet of the Automotive Finance 
										 industry. During my professional career, I developed a niche for implementing the latest technology to streamline the way FMCC does
										 business. For example, while working as a Dealer Service Analyst, I created a SharePoint Team site to house sales and marketing communications; a Customer Service 
										 Department Training site to organize training documents and links to various training FAQs and videos; and a Status Compliance Peer-to-Peer (B2B) site to allow 
										 outside vendors to access related material without VPN access. I also pursued my personal interest in computers by completing the Comp TIA A+ certification along
										 with numerous online courses. <p>

										 </p>After years of answering tech related questions; developing and managing various websites; and spending hours diagnosing and repairing
										  personal computers, I decided to start my own personal computer repair company. I started out as a basic computer repair service. Since Upstate Computer Repair's inception 5 years ago, I have expanded the services to small business software solutions, website 
										 design and remote IT support.</></p>

							<h2>Why Software Engineering Interests Me?</h2>
							
							<p>I want to become a software engineer because I want to create customized web-based solutions 
							that are designed around the end-user's experience. I see software as a powerful way to display 
							content; share ideas; and increase productivity; however, in my experience with existing software,
							 I've found my self limited to generic templates and predesigned content structure that don't meet 
							 more specific needs. As a software engineer, I could create my own templates and customize the way
							 content is displayed based on the end-user experience and deliver products that are easy
							to learn; fun to use; and meet the customers needs completely.
						
						</aside></p>

						<p>I also want to merge my experience as an employee of FMCC; my experience as a small business owner; and my newly obtained 
							software development skills to create new ways to work smarter; not harder. I think that my unique perspective 
							 will empower me to create innovative software solutions that are easier to deploy and maintain in a small
							business environment.
