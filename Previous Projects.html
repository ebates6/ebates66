								<a></a><h2>Previous Website Projects</h2>
								<p>In my current position with FMCC, I manage a group of independent contractors that provide
									onsite support at various dealerships. The contractors are not employees of FMCC<br>and do not
									have VPN access to the companiesinternal network. I quickly noticed that I was sending repeatative emails 
									such as contact info due to personnel changes; procedural<br> guidelines and expense reports to other Business Center's
									because they didn't have access to my business center's shared drive or because the 
									contractors didn't have access to<br> internal sites.</p> 

					<p> As a solution, I created a peer-to-peer or B2B SharePoint site that the contractors could view without VPN access.
						I also utilized the site to store the administrative information that<br> was previous housed on a shared drive. Once
					I constructed the site, all I had to do was share the URL with the contractors and they could access the majority of
				information they<br> needed. I also included FAQ's on how to troublshoot their equipment and links to the various procedures 
			they may need while onsite. I also added a library to store the invoices<br>and expense reports that were previously stored on a
		shared drive. This allowed the various Business Centers to access the expenses anytime they needed it and without having to<br> 
	request it via email; as long as they had permission to view the site, they could access the information they needed. As a added
security measure, I created groups and library<br> permission to ensure that the contractors couldn't access confidential information. </I>

					<h2>Welcome Page</h2>
					<h4>The first step was to create a welcome page - This is a landing page & contains 
						very little info; generally reserved for sharing the site url.</h4>

							</div>
							<h2>Status Specialist Resources page</h2>
							<h4>The second step was to create a public facing tab to house general info such as contact info 
								and FAQs; no special permissions were needed except for read only to access the site.</h4>
							<div class="image">

						</p>				
						<h2>DCA-SD Admin page</h2>
						<h4>The third step was to create a Page to house all the confidential info associated with the DCA-SD Admin role - 
							It was important that only I had permission to this tab so I set a unique admin profile</h4>			
								</div>
								
								<div class="image">
									<img src ="images/SD_SP pg.3x80.jpg" alt="Status Admin screenshot"</>
								</div>
								<h2>Status Deployment Expenses & Invoices page</h2>
								<h4>The forth and final step was to create a storage tab for the expense reports and invoices I routinely shared
									other Business Centers - This tab had a specific permission based on location.
								</h4>
